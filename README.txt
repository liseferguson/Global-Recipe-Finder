Recipe generator is a web app that, with the push of a button, returns a randomly generated country somewhere in the world. If the user is interested in seeing a recipe from this country, they can push another button, which will return the title of the recipe and a photo of it. If they want the entire recipe, they can click another button, which will return the entire recipe. Otherwise, they can click "select another recipe", or "find new region"
