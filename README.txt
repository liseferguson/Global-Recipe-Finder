Summary:

Global Recipe Roulette is a web app that, with the push of a button, returns a randomly generated cuisine from around the world, along with a random recipe of that cuisine. Users can choose to stop there and use that recipe, or click "try another recipe" which starts the process over. Alternatively, users can choose to visit a local restaurant specializing in that cuisine by entering their zip-code into the field, which will redirect them to a Yelp page with resulting restaurants.
